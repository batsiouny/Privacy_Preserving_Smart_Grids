## Privacy-Preserving Smart Grid System

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the performance metrics for the privacy-preserving smart grid system.

## 1. Computational Performance

- **Average computation time per round**: 0.0005 seconds
- **Maximum computation time**: 0.0007 seconds
- **Total computation time**: 0.0105 seconds

## 2. Communication Overhead

- **Average communication overhead**: 0.33 KB per round
- **Total communication overhead**: 0.0065 MB

## 3. Privacy Budget Expenditure

- **Total privacy budget spent**: 11.6000
- **Average privacy budget per round**: 0.5800

## 4. Privacy-Utility Tradeoff

| Configuration | Final MAE | Privacy Level | Utility Loss (%) |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| No Privacy | 1.6282 | None | 0.00 |
| DP Only (ε=1.0) | 2.1792 | Low | 33.84 |
| Secure Agg Only | 1.6679 | Low | 2.44 |
| DP (ε=1.0) + Secure Agg | 1.8402 | High | 13.02 |
| DP (ε=5.0) + Secure Agg | 1.5987 | Medium | -1.81 |

## 5. Blockchain Performance

- **Total blocks**: 8
- **Average nonce (mining difficulty)**: 178.00
- **Maximum nonce**: 891
- **Average block time**: 0.0072 seconds

## 6. Conclusions

The analysis demonstrates the tradeoffs between privacy, utility, and performance in the smart grid system:

1. **Privacy vs. Utility**: Higher privacy levels (lower epsilon values) result in greater utility loss.
2. **Performance Impact**: Privacy mechanisms add computational overhead and increase communication costs.
3. **Blockchain Overhead**: The blockchain integration adds auditability at the cost of additional computation.

## 7. Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend:

1. Using DP with ε=5.0 for a good balance between privacy and utility
2. Implementing secure aggregation to protect individual updates
3. Adjusting blockchain difficulty based on deployment requirements
